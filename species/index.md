This page provides the full cantus firmus exercises of Johann Joseph Fux's iconic pedagogical treatise, 'Gradus ad Parnassum' in three sections:
1. Two Voices (46 exercises)
2. Three Voices (44 exercises)
3. Four Voices (32 exercises)

For each of these sections, we provide four files:

1. Full exercises: all of the cantus firmus exercises with only the cantus firmus present. Note that the numbers are not sequential here because the numbering includes all of Fux’s examples, including setting out what oblique motion is, for instance.
2. Full solutions: all of Fux’s solutions to those exercises – i.e. both cantus firmus and additional part(s).
3. Those solutions annotated with the interval between every note in each additional part and the cantus firmus.
4. Distinct: Every distinct cantus firmus in all parts. All of the exercises are based on this, so these simple files distill all possible exercises: use this to do any species exercise, on any cantus firmus, and either above or below.

## For Reference

Each exercise includes the following information:
- Figure number (in the modern Norton/Mann edition, 1965).
- Species type,
- Modal final,
- Cantus firmus part

For ease of reference, the following sub-section / tables set out that information in full.

Finally, a note on clefs. Those given also follow the Norton/Mann edition (1965) for parts I and II. Part III keeps the same clefs throughout to be consistent both internally and with the modern choral score layout (treble, treble, treble 8, bass). Teachers may wish to choose their own clefs as part of adapting these files for class.

Fux basically uses one cantus firmus for each modal final throughout. The note sequences are as follows, along with their usage counts (46 total) and the minor exceptions:

| Modal final | Pitches | Counts and exceptions |
|---|---|---|
| D | D4, F4, E4, D4, G4, F4, A4, G4, F4, E4, D4| 10 counts |
| E | E4, C4, D4, C4, A3, A4, G4, E4, F4, E4| 10 counts |
| F | F3, G3, A3, F3, D3, E3, F3, C4, A3, F3, G3, F3| 10 counts including one at the octave above, (fig.13: starting F4) |
| G | G3, C4, B3, G3, C4, E4, D4, G4, E4, C4, D4, B3, A3, G3| 6 counts |
| A | A3, C4, B3, D4, C4, E4, F4, E4, D4, C4, B3, A3| 6 counts including one lacking the first D (fig.42: A3, C4, B3, C4, E4 ...) |
| C | C4, E4, F4, G4, E4, A4, G4, E4, F4, E4, D4, C4 | 2 counts. The most anomalous case.|
| C | C4, D4, F4, E4, G4, E4, F4, E4, D4, C4 | 2 counts. More divergent than for the other modes|
