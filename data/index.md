title: Where Can I Find Data?
---

“Where can I find data?" may well be the question I am most often asked by students.
It's a good question, and although the answer changes over time,
there are some relatively stable sites to point to.
This page summarises some of those options as a staring point for further exploration.
All sites have been manually checked against minimal criteria: URL works and data accessible.
Other initiatives like [UNICC](https://www.unicc.org/artificial-intelligence/) are
a matter of "watch this space" and not yet included.
Consider these as you begin to explore what others have created,
so that you can make sure your work complements and/or extends what has gone before,
and that we continue to build a great cathedral of cumulative science together!

### Top Tips

Practical:
- Check _many_ sources, not just one! If in doubt, start with Kaggle/Hugging Face for most beginner projects ... but do branch out to check others once you settle on a topic.
- You may have access to more resources than you think. E.g., some databases require a subscription or similar, but school/university/city library membership might unlock access.
- Accessing data with APIs takes a bit more technical overhead, but that's often worthwhile, especially if you want structured data from/about social media.

Ethical:
- Check licenses (e.g., MIT, etc.) before using data. Most of the datasets on the repositories listed here will have permissive licences that enable research (at least!), but always check.
- "Scraping" websites is possible but should be considered a last resort for want of a better option, and having checked for any indication of permission/restrictions (e.g., `robots.txt` file). 
- ... and many more! E.g., among _your_ ethical considerations should be how _they_ made their datasets.

Sensible:
- In working with data it's likely you'll end up expanding and/or improving it.
Having gone to that trouble, find a way to contribute your work back into the ecosystem!
I.e., this page can double as a "where can I _put_ my data"?

## **Publicly Accessible Data Sources for Analysis**

### For the Data Itself

*✅ Hundreds of thousands of datasets, freely downloadable, across many formats and topics.*

*❌ Quality varies. Most are user-uploads and not subject to quality control (see 'Paired Academic Publications' below).*

- **[Zenodo](http://zenodo.org/)**
  > "Built and operated by CERN and OpenAIRE to ensure that everyone can join in Open Science".
- **[Open Science Foundation (OSF)](https://osf.io/)**
  > A "free, open platform to support your research and enable collaboration".
- **[Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)**  
  > Datasets as well as benchmarks, models and more.
- **[Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets)**  
  > ML-focus. Includes search by modality (text, audio, vision).
- **[GitHub Datasets](https://github.com/datasets)**  
  > This is a small list of curated public datasets via GitHub repos among the  
   many more [datasets on GitHub outside this](https://github.com/).

### **Paired Academic Publications**

*✅ Many datasets (e.g., those at the platforms above) are paired with an academic publication.
Having an associated academic publication (that has been properly reviewed) provides some quality control.*

*❌ The academic journals themselves tend not to host the data (so you need the paired dataset above).
There are many great datasets without a paired academic publication.*

- **Journals focussed entirely on datasets:**  
  > - Some high profile examples include [Data (MDPI)](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/data),
  [Scientific Data (Nature Portfolio)](https://www.nature.com/sdata/),
  [Earth System Science Data](https://www.earth-system-science-data.net/),
  [GigaScience](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience)
  > - Examples specific to the humanities include [Journal of Open Humanities Data (JOHD)](https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/)
- **Humanities journals that include a "track" (or similar) specifically for introducing datasets**
  > - [Digital Humanities Quarterly](https://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/),
  > - [Digital Scholarship in the Humanities](https://academic.oup.com/dsh),
  > - [Cultural Analytics](https://culturalanalytics.org/),
  > - [Transactions of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval (TISMIR)](https://transactions.ismir.net/)

## **Knowledge Graphs and Metadata**

*✅ Knowledge graphs and metadata support sharing of and search over structured representations of knowledge.
Individual datasets like those above may not adhere to such best practices.*

*❌ Use for structure and relationships, not (usually) as a primary source of data.*

- **[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org)**  
  Free, collaborative knowledge base (not Wikipedia). *Use for: Entity relationships, multilingual facts, ontology.*

- **[Europeana](https://www.europeana.eu)**  
  Cultural heritage data (art, books, music). *10M+ items from European museums/libraries.*

---

## **Aggregated and Processed Data**  

*✅ Pre-processed, visualised, and updated by experts.*

*❌ Where the raw data is not provided, this leaves you less scope to explore your own analysis.*

- **[Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org)**  
  > Global development data (health, economy). Includes interactive tools and datasets.

- **[Our World in Data (OWID)](https://ourworldindata.org)**  
  > Rigorous, source-verified datasets on global issues (climate, inequality, ...). 
  Most of the studied include an option to download the data used directly,
  or (failing that) at least provide a redirect to the third-party website hosting that data. 

- **[Google Trends](https://trends.google.com)**  
  > See what the world is searching for by topic (and also region, time, ...).
  Free, but limited to _trends_ (not raw counts).
  See also [Google books' ngram viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams/)

---

## **Paid Resources (but often free via Libraries)**  

*❌ Not easily available to all.*

*✅ May be more available than you think, e.g., via your local library.*

- **[Factiva](https://www.dowjones.com/factiva)**  
  > News, business, and financial data. *Available via university libraries.*
  
- **[NexisLexis](https://www.lexisnexis.com)**  
  > Legal, news, and business databases. *Typically included in academic library subscriptions.*

---

## Further Specific Sources by Type

*✅ Specific sources such as government data tend to be free, high-quality and as authoritative (for their subject) as can be expected.*

*❌ Given the specific focus, the overall scope is more limited than Kaggle, for instance.*

### **Government and Similar**  

- **[data.gov (USA)](https://data.gov)**  
  > 250k+ datasets from US federal agencies (health, environment, economy).
- **[data.gov.uk (UK)](https://data.gov.uk)**  
  > UK public sector data (crime, education, transport).
  Related UK sites include [UK data service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/)
  the [Office for National Statistics (ONS)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/),
  and the [Open Data Institute (ODI)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/) (as a partner, not a source).

## **APIs for Social Media and More**  


*✅ Social media stores a great repository of cultural trends and more.
Many social media and related companies offer APIs which provide a structured set of data and controls for all/only the data the company is content to share.*

*❌ Not all APIs are equal, "free" can be a misnomer, and APIs are more technically demanding than direct downloads.*

- **[Academic Torrents](https://academictorrents.com/docs/downloading.html#)**
  > API or similar (CLI) required. Provided by a non-profit.
- **[GDELT Project](https://www.gdeltproject.org)**
  > Global event data across the media (broadcast, print, and web).
- **[Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api)**  
  > Access Reddit API for posts/comments e.g., via
  [`PRAW` (The Python Reddit API Wrapper)](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
  Note: Tighter restrictions since 2023, e.g., `OAuth2` and Reddit account required.
- **["X" / "Twitter" API](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api)**
    > 'Free', but be wary of rate limits.
- **Facebook**
    >  Not publicly accessible. There are ways, but generally to be avoided.
- **Many other companies like [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)**
    > Restrictions apply and the data coverage can change without warning (it has done so in this case).
    See also secondary representations such as https://spotifyplaylistarchive.com/.
