title: 'Moments Musicaux'
---

Music theory is often highly focused on concepts, categories, and names. We evidently find them useful in helping to organise our understanding of musical style, structure, and technique (notwithstanding the many complications they can attract).

Musicological textbooks, anthologies, and research articles addressing concepts like 'augmented sixths', 'metrical dissonance', and 'sonata form' provide helpful, illustrative examples, but those examples are usually few in number and without evidence in support of their alleged representativeness.

'Moments Musicaux' provides lists of such musical objects at orders of magnitude beyond any existing collections, and combining a range of approaches:
- collations of existing lists for the Neapolitan- and augmented-sixth chords from music theory anthologies, where they invariably feature;
- new (manually collected) lists on a comparable scale, but for two objects which are all but absent from textbooks: ‘mixed’ meter (such as 5/4) and the augmented chord.
- computationally retrieved lists of augmented chords, augmented sixth chords, and the neo-Riemannian L and P relations (R is too common).

This provides a de facto 'anthology' of examples for use in teaching and computational research.
