## Introduction

This section provides a kind of miscellany of additional resources that are 'static', in the sense that there's no fancy, interactive footwork going on -- what you see is what you get! That doesn't necessarily make them any less useful, of course ...

As always, we provide all resources in .xml format so they you can open them in any music notation software and playback or edit passages as you please. Apart from the usual benefits of being able to play back your work etc., you may wish to:
- transpose the 'Rule of the Octave' into a range of suitable keys. You can do this on MuseScore with the 'Notes' menu: Notes/Transpose.
- chose your own set of clefs for the Species exercises. Those given follow the modern Norton/Mann edition (1965).

## Rule of the Octave
<a href="/ROTO/Rule_of_the_Octave.xml" download="ROTO.mxl">Download File</a>

This section provides materials for practicing the 'Rule of the Octave' for harmonising diatonic music.
The harmonisation here is in the form of three upper voices which are closely based on Fedele Fenaroli, Naples 1775, but preserve exactly voices throughout and avoid any suggestion of parallel octaves.
The file provides: the bass scale and
1. each part separately along with the bass and the intervals between each pair of notes.
2. the upper parts combined into a three-part right hand in all three permutations (‘positions’ in Fenaroli’s language);

This is designed to allow for the practice the component parts and literal realisations in order to build fluency with and abstraction of 'the rule'.

This section provides materials relating to the full cantus firmus exercises in Part 1 of Gradus ad Parnassum: writing in two voices (46 exercises in total).

1. Full exercises: all of the cantus firmus exercises with only the cantus firmus present. (The numbers are not sequential here because the numbering includes all of Fux’s examples, including setting out what oblique motion is, for instance.)
2. Full solutions: all of Fux’s solutions to those exercises (i.e. both cantus firmus and species).
3. Those solutions annotated with every harmonic interval.
4. Distinct: Every distinct cantus firmus in both upper and lower parts. All of the exercises are based on this, so this simple file distill all possible exercises: use this to do any species exercise, on any cantus firmus, and either above or below.

Each exercise in 1 and 2 includes the following information:
- Figure number (in the Norton/Mann edition, 1965).
- Species type,
- Modal final,
- Cantus firmus part (upper or lower)

For ease of reference, the following grid sets out that information in full:
<!-- along with the original clefs, and Mann’s replacements. -->

Fux basically uses one cantus firmus for each modal final throughout. The note sequences are as follows, along with their usage counts and the minor exceptions:

| Modal final | Pitches | Counts and exceptions |
|---|---|---|
| D | D4, F4, E4, D4, G4, F4, A4, G4, F4, E4, D4| 10 counts |
| E | E4, C4, D4, C4, A3, A4, G4, E4, F4, E4| 10 counts |
| F | F3, G3, A3, F3, D3, E3, F3, C4, A3, F3, G3, F3| 10 counts including one at the octave above, (fig.13: starting F4) |
| G | G3, C4, B3, G3, C4, E4, D4, G4, E4, C4, D4, B3, A3, G3| 6 counts |
| A | A3, C4, B3, D4, C4, E4, F4, E4, D4, C4, B3, A3| 6 counts including one lacking the first D (fig.42: A3, C4, B3, C4, E4 ...) |
| C | C4, E4, F4, G4, E4, A4, G4, E4, F4, E4, D4, C4 | 2 counts. The most anomalous case.|
| C | C4, D4, F4, E4, G4, E4, F4, E4, D4, C4 | 2 counts. More divergent than for the other modes|
