## Introduction

This section provides a kind of miscellany of additional resources that are 'static', in the sense that there's no fancy, interactive footwork going on -- what you see is what you get! That doesn't necessarily make them any less useful, of course ...

As always, we provide all resources in .xml format so they you can open them in any music notation software and playback or edit passages as you please. Apart from the usual benefits of being able to play back your work etc., you may wish to transpose material into a range of keys. You can do this on MuseScore with the 'Notes' menu: Notes/Transpose.

## Rule of the Octave

This section provides materials for practicing the 'Rule of the Octave' for harmonising diatonic music.
The harmonisation here is in the form of three upper voices which are closely based on Fedele Fenaroli (Naples 1775), but preserving a consistent number of voices throughout and avoid any suggestion of parallel octaves.
The file provides: the bass scale and
1. each part separately along with the bass and the intervals between each pair of notes.
2. the upper parts combined into a three-part right hand in all three permutations (‘positions’ in Fenaroli’s language);

This is designed to allow for the practice the component parts and literal realisations in order to build fluency with and abstraction of 'the rule'.
