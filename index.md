## About

‘Four Score and More’ is a social enterprise founded in 2018 which is dedicated to providing high-quality, digital resources for the teaching and learning of music, particularly music theory.

We aim to provide resources that:
- are immediately useful;
- save teachers' preparation time so they can focus on teaching;
- enhance the learning experience through interactivity (of playback, for instance);
- help to democratise access by being free for all and accompanied by user-friendly instructions. We aim to enable anyone interested to develop their skills for free.

## What’s in a name?

‘Four score’ is an old-fashioned method of counting, where a ‘score’ is a group or set of twenty. So, when Lincoln opened the Gettysburg Address by talking about the founding of America ‘four score and seven years ago’, he meant 87 years before 1863, i.e. 1776. Therefore, ‘four score and more’ amounts to ‘more than 80’ which, in musical terms is resonant as the number of keys on a modern, full-size piano (there’s some variety, but they’re mostly all in that range of 80+).

Clearly, it also puns on ‘for scores and more’, which summarises the initiative’s core project, focused on scores but also including other forms of engagement with music and musical pedagogy. Nerdier still, even the logo puns on the idea of _4+_, using the figured bass for an augmented 4th, enlarging it, and placing it within the stave to make it look like a treble clef.

Anyway, hopefully it’s a memorable title, and a bit of fun.
