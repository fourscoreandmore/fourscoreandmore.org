## Chorale Exercise Generator

This page generates music theory completion exercises based on Bach chorales.

Please make the following choices and click submit when you're ready:

1. Chorale
Search for and select one of the chorales by BWV number (or opt for a random choice).

2. Voices to Cut
Choose which voices to remove (any or all of alto, tenor, and bass).

3. Number of Beats to Cut
Decide on a number of tactus beats ('crotchet' / 'quarter note') to cut from each phrase.

4. Full / Short Score
Finally, would you like the exercise in full score (one stave for each voice), or short score (two staves with S-A and T-B parts).
