The text below gives you a sense of what to expect.

## Lieder Exercise Generator

This page generates music theory completion exercises based on Romantic songs.

Please make the following choices and click submit when you're ready:

1. Song
Search for and select one of the songs we have available (or opt for a random choice).

2. RestBars
Choose whether or not to leave the piano part in for the bars where the voice part is resting.

3. Quarter Length Of Rest
What does 'resting' mean? Chose a length (in 'quarter notes' / â€˜crotchets') that acts as the benchmark. So, when the combined length of rests in one bar (measure) of the vocal part add up to this value, the 'leave rests' option will be activated (if selected).

4. Leave Bass Line
Whatever else is going on, leave the left hand piano part intact and just work on the right hand.

5. Additions
Having removed parts of the original score, you can now chose from the following additions:
- No addition;
- 'Transfer Tune': Copy the vocal melody into the piano RH (except for the rest bars if applicable)
- 'Chord Hints': Input provisional chords based on leaps in the melodic line.

6. Quarter Length of Harmonic Rhythm
If you chose the chord hints option, what harmonic rhythm should these be based on?
Please specify the length in 'quarter notes' ('crotchets') of that harmonic rhythm.
