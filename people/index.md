Like a lot of start up enterprises liberally using the word 'we', there's actually one person
at the centre of Four Score and More, deeply immersed in (at least co-running) each of the projects.
That person (also writing this text) is:
- [Mark Gotham](https://markgotham.github.io/)

Fortunately for him (me), a growing number of great people are contributing to 'Four Score And More',
either as directly involved collaborators, or in important advisory roles.
Here is some info on them:

## Collaborators and Credits

### Cut Outs, Working in Harmony, and more
- [Patrick Dawkins](https://patrickdawkins.com/), violinist and PHP developer

### Scores of Scores
- The [MuseScore team](https://musescore.com), especially [Peter Jonas](https://musescore.com/shoogle), OpenScore Manager
- [Edward Guo of IMSLP](http://imslp.org/)

### Harp
- This interactive guide to the pitch properties of the pedal harp was developed by Iain Gunn and I in 2016 and first published as part of a paper for [Music Theory Online](http://mtosmt.org/issues/mto.16.22.4/mto.16.22.4.gotham.html).

### Species
- These files are based on public domain transcriptions by [Jay Wilson](https://musescore.com/user/43726/) and (like most of our offerings) made using code built on top of the [music21 library](http://web.mit.edu/music21/). Thank you Jay! Thank you music21!

### Partimenti
- Developed in consultation with the magnificent [Roger Moseley](https://music.cornell.edu/roger-moseley)

### Scored-up Scores
- Made using code built on top of [Laurent Pugin](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/p/Pugin:Laurent)'s fabulous [Verovio](https://www.verovio.org/index.xhtml)

### Moments
- Thanks to the people and teams who produced the score transcriptions on from which this data is extracted (several as detailed on that page).
