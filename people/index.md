Like a lot of start up enterprises liberally using the word 'we', there's actually one person
at the centre of FourScoreAndMore, deeply immersed in (at least co-running) each of the projects.
That person (also writing this text) is:

## Founder-Director

- [Mark Gotham](https://www.mus.cam.ac.uk/directory/mark-gotham)

Fortunately for him (me), a growing number of great people are contributing to FourScoreAndMore,
either as directly involved collaborators, or in important advisory roles.
Here is some info on them:

## Collaborators

- [Patrick Dawkins](https://patrickdawkins.com/);
- [Prof Neil Dodgson](http://neildodgson.com/), the Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand;
- The good people at [MuseScore](https://musescore.com), especially [Peter Jonas](https://musescore.com/shoogle), OpenScore Manager;
- [Edward Guo of IMSLP](http://imslp.org/);
- [Prof Sally Jane Norman](https://www.victoria.ac.nz/nzsm/about/staff/sallyjane-norman),
Director of the New Zealand School of Music

## Advisory Board

- [Ryaan Ahmed](ryaanahmed.com)
- Michael Scott Cuthbert, [Associate Professor at MIT](https://mta.mit.edu/person/michael-scott-cuthbert) and Founder of [Artusi](https://www.artusi.xyz/);

## Funders

Grateful acknowledgement goes to the [The University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) for funding in support of Projects 1 and 2. Here are the specific funds and remit of our activity in those areas:
- ‘Scores of Scores’ is funded by the [Arts and Humanities Impact Fund](https://www.ahssresearch.group.cam.ac.uk/AH-Impact-Fund).
- ‘Cut Outs’ is funded by the [The Teaching and Learning Innovation Fund](https://www.cctl.cam.ac.uk/support-and-training/funding/teaching-and-learning-innovation-fund).

Additionally a number of partners have come together to put on the [‘Scores of Scores’ Launch Event](https://www.bigdata.cam.ac.uk/events/cambridge-big-data-events/2018scores-of-scores2019-possibilities-and-pitfalls-with-musical-corpora) (details on that page).

Finally, from mid 2018, I (Mark Gotham) will be working as a 'Postdoctoral Associate in Computational Music Theory Pedagogy' at the beautiful and brilliant Cornell University in up-state New York. [The role](http://www.mtosmt.org/mto-jobs.php?id=714) is directly relevant to FourScoreAndMore's activities, and the powers that be are committed to open source, so the show will go on.

Thank you all!
