Like a lot of start up enterprises liberally using the word 'we', there's actually one person
at the centre of Four Score and More, deeply immersed in (at least co-running) each of the projects.
That person (also writing this text) is:
- [Mark Gotham](MG_bio/)

Fortunately for him (me), a growing number of great people are contributing to 'Four Score And More',
either as directly involved collaborators, or in important advisory roles.
Here is some info on them:
