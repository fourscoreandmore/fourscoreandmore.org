Notes for transcribers
---

Welcome!

Thanks for participating in this very exciting encoding project.

In this project you’ll find a wonderful corpus of songs … or rather just the melodic line of those songs, desperately in need of piano parts. That’s where you come in! Please encode the piano parts to complete the songs.

Basically this is a normal [OpenScore](https://openscore.cc) encoding project, except that here some of the job has been done for you! Simply:

1. Pick an available score [from the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jec8rYm3Z7PqnxmFWztfqLAV0NVYwn2D5-umTGeatiU/edit?usp=sharing).
1. Update the spreadsheet to assign yourself (add your MuseScore username).
1. Find the template score via the "Template score URL" link. The score's description will include a link to a recommended IMSLP source score (a PDF).
1. Open the template score in MuseScore, add a piano part, and encode away!
1. Upload your finished score to the [Lieder Corpus pilot group](https://musescore.com/groups/lieder-corpus-pilot). Set the status to "REVIEW" in the spreadsheet.
1. Rinse and repeat!

## FAQs

**Why are we doing this repertoire?**

This is an important candidate repertoire for transcription for many reasons:

  - The repertoire needs to exist in multiple keys to support different singers’ ranges. Encoded formats give full flexibility.

  - It is a key repertoire for the teaching of music theory for various reasons (about which you’ll see more from me in due course!), not least of which being that it’s a great way to improve the representation of women composers on the syllabus.

  - The encoding of vocal lines and text is already well underway thanks to another, previous para-academic project which has provide the starting point here.

**Where have these vocal lines come from?**

We have inherited this corpus of vocal lines from Leigh Van Handel et al. who created these partial scores in another file format for a research project. Leigh has kindly given us permission to use them as the basis for our present goal of creating full encodings (thanks Leigh!).

**Are they perfect?**

Unfortunately not. Converting file formats can be hazardous business. I have used some great existing code for converting these files (thanks Myke Cuthbert, Craig Sapp, et al.!) and written some more to fix certain problems unique to these pieces, but it’s hard to get a 100% success rate. Look out for the occasional:

- Odd lyrics, e.g. with `}` or a number.
- More odd lyrics: with accents that should / shouldn’t be there.
- Ghostly second voices that shouldn’t be there.
- Errors with grace notes.
- Bars rest missing (very common).

**Are the vocal lines complete?**

Often not. Please do encode the rest of the melodic line and text if you’re happy to do so. If the song is long, then perhaps focus on another, shorter piece first so we can get more songs finished. If all of the music is there, but not all of the verses, then that’s fine for now – thanks! We’re aiming for complete music.

**Why aren’t there piano parts?**

That wasn’t part of the Van Handel et al. study and it turns out to be much more reliable simply to add the part in MuseScore than to add them automatically.

**Is there an Editorial ‘policy’?**

Absolutely … of a sort. [See below](#editorial-policy).

**I can’t find my score on IMSLP. Little help please?**

Many apologies. If it’s a question of insufficient information then there’s a nearly complete list of composer, title, opus numbers information in the .CSV file provided – you can open this up in Excel or similar find your song and hopefully then have more information for searching. If it’s definitely not on IMSLP then we’ll have to put it there!

**What key should I use?**

Often, IMSLP will have the same song in multiple keys. If so, pick the one that matches the file you have and go for it! Where IMSLP only has other keys, please transpose the file and do your transcription in the key of the IMSLP source (rechecking the vocal line's accidentals). You’ll find that’s much easier!

**This score is corrupted / unacceptably full or errors.**

Sorry about that. Let us know the offending score’s name and we’ll see if it’s redeemable / speaks to a wider problem. In the meantime, there are plenty more!

**Got any timesaving tips?**

I sure do! The main one is to look out for any repetitions, either exact or partial. If a whole section is repeated then that’s obvious: copy and paste! Often you’ll find more equivocal cases. For instance, many of these songs have a repeating accompaniment pattern; it may be worth copying one over and changing the pitches if the pattern is exact, the voice leading between notes is close, and you are careful to work through systematically. Otherwise copy and paste might cause more problems than it’s worth …

**Is this good for me?**

Absolutely! Apart from helping the music community, encoders benefit from the task of copy-editing music itself – musicians have written out scores as part of their education for as long as records exist. The story of Wagner copying out Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony twice stands as a famous testament to this.

## Editorial ‘policy’

‘Policy’ is in quotes here because we are simply aiming for a pragmatic solution with minimal adjustments to reach a plausible editorial level. Basically, this is a summary of what you will find (and should do in any new encoding):

- Separate stems (no beams) for notes with one syllable
- No melisma continuation lines
- Use `ss` (not the Eszett `ß`) and similar

I hope you find these acceptable at least for the time being. Most of them we can automate a fix for if we choose to later (e.g. after the main encoding drive). If you are sure you’ve found something that doesn’t correspond to this policy then please do make the change. Please get in touch if you discover consistent errors or editorial policy decisions that should be on this list!
