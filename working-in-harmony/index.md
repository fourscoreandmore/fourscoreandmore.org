Welcome!

The 'Working in Harmony' offers automatic feedback on Roman numeral analysis -- a kind of analytical 'spell-checker'.
It's not here to 'give out the answers', but simply to help out by catching typo-style errors.
If you appreciate having a spell checker for your text documents, and would like something similar for your Roman numeral analysis, then you came to the right place!

Our aim is to support absolutely any music you have available in a suitable format.
In this initial 'alpha' release, we are trialing this app with songs in the lieder corpus only.

## How to use this app

1. Choose a score from the dropdown list of lieder. [Coming soon: We aim to offer this for any music you have access to in an ‘encoded’ format that can convert to musicxml (midi, kern, Sibelius, Finale, etc.).]
2. Write your analysis down and upload it following [these instructions](./analysis.md).
3. The system will evaluate your work and provide:
  - a new version of the score, with your analysis included on it as a lowest part;
  - a separate text file with feedback on your analysis.
4. Correct any errors you find and re-upload for a new review as many times as you like.

All set?
