Marking can get complicated. Difficulties include the:
- _time pressure_ with limited time per script,
- _maintaining consistency_ across a large number of scripts (and the variable concentration level across many hours of marking),
- _tendency towards subjectivity_ perhaps especially when marking long free-form essays.
- and much more besides.

It can even be difficult even to remember all the different kinds of feedback that could provide useful constructive criticism to students.

This simple app is designed to help assessors to organise their thoughts in the preparation of feedback.

[Click here to use the app](./feedback_app.html).


## How to use this app

Users are presented with:
- a reminder of the many topics that might be relevant,
- a 5-point Likert scale for organising the positive negative feedback.

All the topics default to "N/A" and will be ignored unless clicked.
Users then:
- Choose which topics to actively comment on (positively or negatively) and add free prose on that topic.
- Enter brief comments for the piece overall (topic, one adjective, and a summary of the feedback).
- Click "SUBMIT" to receive a draft text based on these choices.

Hopefully that draft will give a sense of whether the appropriate feedback has appropriate balance and coverage.
Users can then adapt this text to their own specifications, or decide against and write one from scratch.

Please note:
- this is a fully deterministic system, no AI (LLMs etc) are involved
- the licence is MIT: functionality provided open source, as is, with no liability ... so ... .
- ... please make sure that your use of this app is consistent with the requirements for your use case.

Happy marking!
