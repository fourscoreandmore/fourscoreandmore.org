title: 'Participation'
---

We are proud to run participation projects whereby those learning music can also contribute to these kinds of projects while they learn.

We began with:
* [**Scores of Scores**](/scores-of-scores): a large-scale contribution to the provision of publicly-available encoded scores (necessary for [Cut Outs](/cut-outs), [Scored-up Scores](/scored-up-scores) and all projects like them).

... and we are now focussed on ...

* [**Working in Harmony**](/working-in-harmony): an effort to crowd-source a comparable corpus of harmonic analyses.
