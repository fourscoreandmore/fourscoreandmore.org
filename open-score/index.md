Welcome to the 'OpenScore' collections of 
carefully transcribed scores 
released under the maximally permissive CC0 licence.

There are three collections.
These three links below will take you to the full set, including links to download individual items:
- [Lieder, c.1,300 songs](./lieder)
- Orchestral works, c.100 movements (to follow soon)
- String Quartets, c.100 multi-movement quartets (to follow soon)

In the spirit of open scores, this site serves to provide 
direct download to individual files without any login and certainly no payment.

Here's an example from the lieder collection:

## More information

If you've scrolled this far, you're probably looking for more information.
Here goes!

### History

‘OpenScore’ began with a 2017 initiative to encode sheet music
chosen by sponsors of a crowdfunding campaign, but the effort
took off in earnest in 2018 with the launch of a (then 'satellite')
project focussing specifically on 19th-century songs.
The 'OpenScore Lieder Corpus' (as it became known) now includes over 1,300
songs in a range of languages on MuseScore.com and also exists
in a GitHub.com mirror specifically for corpus study/MIR research (as above).

The 'satellite' did not seek crowd-funding,
but it did benefit from the crowd-sourced contributions of a gradually evolving team of
transcribers, reviewers, and managers.
This is axiomatic to 'OpenScore' efforts:
not only to serve a range of communities (musicians, academics, others),
but also to engage those groups in the creation of the corpus.

In 2023, the next generation of that evolving team released a new 
OpenScore corpus effort specifically for string quartets.
That time, we were able to present at the same time both the public-facing
collection on MuseScore.com and the dataset on GitHub for use by
the MIR community.

2025 sees the third OpenScore corpus, of Orchestral works.
Full paper and explanation to follow.

## Are the various site and repos all the same repos?

The OpenScore GitHub repo is the version info record, including uncompressed scores
to support version control.
This fourscoreandmore set is a duplicate of the scores but not of the format.
Here we provide _compressed_ MuseScore (mscz) and MusicXML (mxl) scores.
These minimise the file size (and we're not tracking changes here).
