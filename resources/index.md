## Classroom-ready

Completed resources that are tried, tested, and ready to use:

* [**Cut Outs**](/cut-outs): musical scores with parts ‘cut out’ for the student to complete. This
is an ancient teaching method given new life in the digital domain.

* [**Harp**](./harp.html): An interactive guide to the pitch properties of the pedal harp.

* [**Grounded**](/grounded): exercises and examples of ground bass composition.

* [**Partimenti**](/partimenti): files for teaching/learning the 'schemas' based on short, 'partimento' bass lines that Eighteenth-Century musicians learned as stock-in-trade prototypes for improvisation and composition.

* [**Species**](/species): Species Counterpoint exercises, solutions, and more.

## Work in Progress

Resources that we are actively working on, in varying states of readiness:

* [**'Moments Musicaux'**](/moments): lists of chords and other musical objects at orders of magnitude beyond any existing anthology or textbook collections, and combining a range of approaches.

* [**Scored-up Scores**](/scored-up-scores): interactive introductions to works by encoding and
visualising aspects of its structure for the user to explore.

* [**Simple Harmonic Motion**](/simple-harmonic-motion): an interactive, online teacher of basic conducting
technique in collaboration with the Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand.
